Project Exam 1 </br>

My first year exam project.

Description:
This is my first exam project. The task is to make a blogpage out of a prototype made in Figma.
The website needs to be responsive on different screen sizes, WCAG and SEO compatible. It needs to display items on the page using javascript to pull from an API on a wordpress site.

good for inspiration.
